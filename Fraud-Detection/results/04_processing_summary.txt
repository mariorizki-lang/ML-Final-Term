DATA PROCESSING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

Original Dataset:
- Total samples: 590,540
- Features: 163
- Class 0: 569,877
- Class 1: 20,663
- Imbalance ratio: 1:27.58

Train-Validation Split (80-20):
- Train samples: 472,432
- Validation samples: 118,108

Feature Scaling:
- Method: StandardScaler
- Applied to: Both train and validation sets
- All features scaled to mean=0, std=1

Class Imbalance Handling:
- Method: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- Before SMOTE: 455,902 vs 16,530 (1:27.58)
- After SMOTE: 455,902 vs 455,902 (1:1.00)
- Synthetic samples created: 439,372

Final Training Set (Balanced):
- X_train_balanced: (911804, 163)
- y_train_balanced: (911804,)
- Memory: 566.96 MB

Final Validation Set:
- X_val_scaled: (118108, 163)
- y_val: (118108,)
- Class distribution preserved (stratified)
